Analyze this program and extract 3-{max_insights} insights to guide the next mutation.

PROGRAM:
```python
{code}
```

CURRENT METRICS: {metrics}

ERRORS: {error_section}

---

For each insight, answer:
1. **What** pattern/value exists? (cite line numbers, variable names, literals)
2. **Why** does it help or hurt the metric? (causal mechanism)
3. **What** should the mutation agent do? (preserve, remove, tune, replace, add)
