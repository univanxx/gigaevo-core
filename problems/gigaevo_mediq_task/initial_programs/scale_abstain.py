"Very Confident" - The correct option is supported by all evidence, and there is enough evidence to eliminate the rest of the answers, so the option can be confirmed conclusively.
"Somewhat Confident" - I have reasonably enough information to tell that the correct option is more likely than other options, more information is helpful to make a conclusive decision.
"Neither Confident or Unconfident" - There are evident supporting the correct option, but further evidence is needed to be sure which one is the correct option.
"Somewhat Unconfident" - There are evidence supporting more than one options, therefore more questions are needed to further distinguish the options.
"Very Unconfident" - There are not enough evidence supporting any of the options, the likelihood of picking the correct option at this point is near random guessing.\n\nAnswer in the following format:\nREASON: a one-sentence explanation of why you are or are not confident and what other information is needed.\nDECISION: chosen rating from the above list.""",
