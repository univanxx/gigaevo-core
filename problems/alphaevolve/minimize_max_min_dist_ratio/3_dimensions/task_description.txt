TASK DEFINITION – MINIMIZING DISTANCE RATIO (14 POINTS IN 3D)

Challenge: Non-convex geometric optimization in 3D space. Place 14 distinct points to minimize the squared ratio of maximum to minimum pairwise distances. Target: ratio² ≤ 4.1658

OBJECTIVE
Return 14 distinct 3D coordinates such that:
1) (Distinctness) All points are distinct (no duplicates)
2) (Finiteness) All coordinates are finite real numbers (no NaN or infinity)
3) (Minimality) The squared ratio (max_distance / min_distance)² is minimized

Output: (14, 3) NumPy array  |  Fitness: (max_dist/min_dist)²  |  Goal: ratio² ≤ 4.1658

CONSTRAINTS
- Exactly 14 distinct points in 3D Euclidean space
- All pairwise distances must be finite and positive
- Minimum pairwise distance must be at least 1e-9

FAILURE MODES
- Point clustering (very small minimum distances); extreme spreads (very large maximum distances)
- Duplicate or overlapping coordinates; collinear arrangements creating poor ratios
- Unbounded coordinates causing numerical instability
- Float precision errors leading to degenerate point configurations

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY
This is a non-convex geometric optimization problem with many local minima. The optimal configuration likely involves regular patterns such as symmetric arrangements, sphere packings, or polyhedral structures. Small coordinate changes can significantly affect the distance ratio due to changes in either the minimum or maximum pairwise distance. The search space includes discrete failure regions (duplicate points) and continuous low-fitness basins (clustered or poorly distributed configurations). Solutions must balance global uniformity with local spacing constraints. For 3D space, optimal arrangements often involve geometric structures like truncated tetrahedra, octahedra, or other symmetric polyhedra.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Implement `def entrypoint():` that returns a (14, 3) NumPy array:
- Shape: (14, 3) array of point coordinates (x, y, z)
- All coordinates must be finite real numbers
- Use numpy, scipy, sklearn, or standard library as needed
- Fix random seeds if using randomness (e.g., np.random.seed(42))
- Return type: np.ndarray with dtype float32, shape (14, 3)
