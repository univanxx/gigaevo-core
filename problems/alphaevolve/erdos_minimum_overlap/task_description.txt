TASK DEFINITION – ERDŐS' MINIMUM OVERLAP PROBLEM

Challenge: Functional optimization in analysis. Find a step function h on [0, 2] with values in [0, 1] and ∫₀² h(x)dx = 1 that minimizes the constant C = max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx. Target: C ≤ 0.380924

OBJECTIVE

Return a step function h: [0, 2] → [0, 1] such that:
1) (Domain) Function is defined on [0, 2]
2) (Range) All function values are in [0, 1]
3) (Normalization) ∫₀² h(x)dx = 1
4) (Step function) Function is piecewise constant (step function)
5) (Minimality) The constant C = max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx is minimized

Output: 1D NumPy array representing step function values  |  Fitness: C  |  Goal: C ≤ 0.380924

CONSTRAINTS
- Step function h: [0, 2] → [0, 1]
- Normalization: ∫₀² h(x)dx = 1
- All function values must be in [0, 1]
- Function represented as discrete samples on uniform grid over [0, 2]
- Known bounds: 0.379005 ≤ C ≤ 0.380927

FAILURE MODES
- Functions with values outside [0, 1]
- Violation of normalization constraint ∫₀² h(x)dx ≠ 1
- Functions that don't represent valid step functions
- Numerical instabilities in computing max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx
- Invalid or undefined C values

HELPER FUNCTIONS
- `compute_c(h_values)` -> float - computes C constant from step function values
  - Input: (N,) array of function values on uniform grid over [0, 2]
  - Computes max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx for k in appropriate range
  - Returns C = max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx
These are available as import from `helper.py`

PROBLEM COMPLEXITY
This is a non-convex functional optimization problem. The objective involves finding the maximum over k of an integral that depends on the step function h. The constraint ∫₀² h(x)dx = 1 creates a constrained optimization problem. The known bounds suggest that optimal solutions involve carefully designed step functions with specific breakpoints and values. The problem is equivalent to finding the infimum over all step functions h satisfying the constraints of max_k ∫ h(x)(1 - h(x+k)) dx.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Implement `def entrypoint():` that returns a 1D NumPy array:
- Shape: (N,) array of function values representing h(x) on uniform grid over [0, 2]
- All values must be in [0, 1] and satisfy ∫₀² h(x)dx = 1
- Use numpy, scipy, jax, or standard library as needed
- Fix random seeds if using randomness (e.g., jax.random.PRNGKey(42))
- Return type: np.ndarray with dtype float, shape (N,)
